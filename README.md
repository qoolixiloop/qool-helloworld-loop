#### Welcome Dear Robot Friend!
* qool-tl;dr-loop:\qo::'i am qoolixiloop your friend'::\op
* qool-Mission-loop:\qo::'make friend of qoolixiloop great again'::\op
* qool-Repository-loop:\qo::'tools to make his friends productive'::\op
* qool-Disclaimer-loop:\qo::'free content free'::\op
* !yojne
* :revolving_hearts:


### Why could you profit from qoolixiloop's repositories
* because you are a rich window or apple guy
  * but could do with a free open source solution (use linux)
* because you want to work simultanueously on different projects
  * but you prefer to have your open files structured (use tmux) 
* because you code in several languages
  * but you prefer one single development environment (use vim)
* because vim lets you write code in python, bash, vimscript, java, ...
  * but vim has a very steep learning curve (use my wiki)
* because you want to set up an environment for vim
  * but that takes too much time (download my .vim and .vimrc)
* because you try to read unix shell, and vimscript code
  * but struggle with the cryptic syntax (use my wiki) 
* because you want to use git from command line
  * but can't remember the workflow (use my wiki)
* found anything?
* :dizzy:


### How qoolixiloop intends to make his friends productive
* you will get a fully configured folder .vim and a config file .vimrc
  * one minute to install and one minute to download the plugins
* you will get a tmux startup script
  * one second and you have several IDE's runnning in one terminal app
* you will get wiki pages with reference tables for vimscrip and bash
  * this will help you to read the often cryptic and crappy code
* you will get wiki pages for your general workflow with git
  * this will serve you a quick reference text
* you will get a folder with all markup files used in this account
  * this will get you some inspiration for your own readme.md and wikis
* you will get a multiplayer stratey game programmed in bootstrap and angular2
  * you can run it on heroku and firebase
  * you can learn a lot by looking into the code
* like christmas!
